Standing on familiar blood,
Arms with metal tools that kill.
A thousand shoes that march,
Yet many more lie still.

Deafening screams and shots and bolts,
But silence is all that's heard.
The soldier's dark grey frowns are bold,
End is for what they yearned.

Amidst all war and death and sorrow
When there remains no will to survive,
Comes mind's true blank with a deathly trance,
That ends with the young man's life.
