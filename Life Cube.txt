Because life, is just like a Rubik's Cube.

There are a million ways to solve it, the easy ones, the hard ones. The ones that follow predefined rules and the ones that challenge authority and make their own rules.

But in the end,
There's only one definite arrangement where the pieces will fall, solving everything, regardless of the path.

And contrary to popular belief, the toughest part is not the solving of the cube, but to think of what to do of a cube that's solved.
