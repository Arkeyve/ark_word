As the golden yellow liquid falls on your barren tongue, it hits you gently with a strange bitter, phasing into heavenly sweet as the kiss of an angel embracing you with her holy wings, banishing all of winter's sins.  The elixir of life then fades into the catacombs of the human body, preaching the divine nature of the supreme soul in whose architecture, we're all believed to live in.
