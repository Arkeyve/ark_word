I've come across an obvious epiphany, but better late than never. My absence would serve me well, and hence is a selfish deed. I will be saved of the cyclic redundancy of inane comments, a loquacious fool who believes his stand to be in the heavens, and the need of a laconic and unctuous behavior. I would also be saved of the risk of potential spoilers and constant disturbance over trivial affairs. You, in the same, will be equally benefited. Hence I must leave.
