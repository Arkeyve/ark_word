Gods do exist. But not as we know them. It is but a term made by the humans as a tool to define anything, nay, everything they couldn't define. An excellent tool to define 'moral infinity'. With time, humans have succeeded in defining 'god' in parts, and they still are. But this 'god' will never cease to exist.

That's just a speculation, among all others that will eternally exist. However, it is undeniably true, that god, as humans believe them to be, as omnipotent beings harnessing the power to call upon the judgement of life and death, is nothing, but a mere reflection of human frailty.
