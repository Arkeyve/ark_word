In the deepest dungeons were we born, and in the same shall we rot. Without an essence of wisdom, all in pursuit of meaningless human delights. Humans were abandoned for their greed. And hence, cursed with a heart, a weak soul, and utter foolishness, they beg for mercy. Never do they realise, had the gods been so merciful, they wouldn't have left us stranded between the two great realms of life and death, of angels and demons.

Demons are nothing, but angels that fall. Sins, once committed, can never be ignored. Not even an angel's overwhelming glory can compel time to pass by. Power corrupts, glory fades, so does everything else, and that has caused countless angels to fall. Gradually falling into the will of Hades, turning into despicable beings, epitome of death and destruction.

But no change is irreversible. Life or death, are terms too vague. Thus, simply ridding the sins won't be enough. That will only grant a mortal form of a lowly human, a parole, if looked at closely.

There's no life or death. There's just a wandering soul in search of stable existence. Some find it on the peak of Mount Olympus, others fall for the depths of Styx. Humanity simply serves it's purpose as a passage to either.
