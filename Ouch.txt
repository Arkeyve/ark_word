You know that feeling when someone pushes you off a cliff and you fall down crushing every bone in your body and you only wish that you had died? But your entire body is defunct and you cannot move or crawl or lift your arms and kill yourself. But wait, there's a twist. Where you fell is a land beyond human, or even feral reach, so there's no hope of someone reaching out to help you, or an animal killing you. You just lie there, a wastefull mass of torn flesh, broken bones and blood dripping in dry sand inching it's way inside you only deepening the agony. But you're helpless, and the only way to end your misery, is to starve to death.
