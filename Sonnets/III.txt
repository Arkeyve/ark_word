Gone are the days when rhymes would humble me,
Now my heart is pale and bitter with injuries.
Shell of silence that moulded me,
Is clenching in dissent with the mind that's free.
Such is the conflict between the heart and the brain,
Arouses in the throat, arouses with pain,
The remains of war, as any war would have,
Expressed through the eyes, but hidden in the rain.
The damage, as the soul suffers,
Takes it's toll as it's wing flutters.
Truth be told, no heart is stone,
It's time that oft builds that frozen throne,
Troubled by the most common disease,
Yet I wonder what troubles me.
