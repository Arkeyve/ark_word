Truth be told, I more fear than love.
Mask'd in silence, my veins trembl'd be.
Not stars not moon display such delicacy,
Yet walk thee on earth, with wings we dare not see.
Gifted in excellence, that I could not deserve,
What brilliance in sight, that oozes out 'f thee.
Pluck'd art thou as heaven's holy seed,
To bloom on earth and bless our cree.
Humbled am I by your sight that I hold,
Unhumbled be those that cussed thy glee.
So put in my ears, ye maiden of gold,
The melody of thine voice, the great Gods told.
Forsaken I am, for thee to bring me,
For I hold much to give, yet not much given be.
