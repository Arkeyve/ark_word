Divine in creation, what lies yonder,
Reachless to all that couldn't fond her,
But 'tis not she, 'tis my selfish plea,
Altered in truth, as truth may be.
Artless and bare as autumn trees,
Soulless and numb as scarred disease.
And more exist, them adjective tools,
Define this humble, unfavored fool.
Architect of pain and his own surcease,
Path of a stooge, of claimed injuries.
I do agree I am bitter,
Rude to gifts and lights and glitter.
Eludes me what is chased by me,
Eluded be, what chases me.
